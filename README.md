When I created my portfolio, I used some basic UI/UX principles to make it simple, clear, and easy to use. One important principle I applied was simplicity. I made sure the layout was not too crowded and the design was clean, so visitors can focus on my name, projects, and information. I also used visual hierarchy by placing my name and navigation menu at the top, which makes it easy for users to know where they are and where to go next. I chose a gradient color design because it adds beauty and style, while still keeping the text readable. I also used semantic HTML tags like header, main, nav to make the website more organized.
The main challenge I faced was about design and readability. At first, some colors made the text hard to see, so I adjusted the colors to have better contrast. Another challenge was making the website responsive. At the beginning, it looked fine on a laptop but not on a phone. I solved this by using CSS media queries and flexible layouts so the site can adjust to different screen sizes.

Next, I would like to improve my portfolio by adding more interactive features. For example, I want to add hover effects, simple animations, and a photo carousel for my projects. I also plan to add a contact form so people can reach me easily. These improvements will make my portfolio not only more professional but also more engaging for users.
